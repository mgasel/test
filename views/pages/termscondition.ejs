                            3ndk platform is an innovative solution that connects laundry customers with laundry shops by offering a pickup/delivery service. Our business model is simple; 3ndk platform will connect customers, laundry shops and drivers through mobile/web applications. 3NDK platform may conduct a background check for each provider, but 3NDK does not and cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any background check or that a particular Provider is qualified to perform a particular Job, as it is solely the responsibility of each Provider, and not 3NDK, to determine whether they are qualified and capable of completing a particular Job. Even when accurate, background checks do not necessarily predict future behavior. WHEN YOU REQUEST SERVICES FROM OR OTHERWISE INTERACT WITH A PROVIDER, YOU SHOULD EXERCISE COMMON SENSE AND CAUTION TO PROTECT YOUR AND OTHERS' PERSONAL PROPERTY AND PERSONAL SAFETY, INCLUDING BY SUPERVISING PROVIDERS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT YOU WOULD SUPERVISE ANYONE ELSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO YOU THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW.

                    <b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</b>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Generally, in the interest of resolving disputes between you and 3NDK in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and 3NDK Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and 3NDK are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. Notwithstanding the above, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable state/territory, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
                        <li>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").</li>
                        <li>The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or 3NDK may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or 3NDK shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, 3NDK shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by 3NDK in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.</li>

You may not assign or transfer the Terms of Service or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign the Terms of Service at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms of Service constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of the Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</li>
